Ravio Cosplay Code
==================


Overview
========
I'm working on a cosplay of Ravio, the shopkeeper from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and I'm storing the code for it here.
I'm working on electronics for various items, and the code for those will be stored here.
There is also a physical log book for this project. Not all notes will be stored here.
Percentages mark expected progress for next event (nothing is ever completely done).

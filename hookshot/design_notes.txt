| Hookshot Prototype One: Scotch Yoke |
+-------------------------------------+

Result:
Due to the mechanics of the stoch yoke, it is effectively impossible to fully extend it via the handle.
Though it is easy to move when it's mostly retracted.

The wide holes with bolts are too loose.
That looseness causes what I'll call "droop".
When the handle is in the retracted position, the scissors can still fall about 1/4 of the way out due to looseness.

When it's fully extended, it droops downward due to gravity.
This strongly locks the scissors in the extended position.


+-------------------------------+
| Hookshot Prototype Two: Winch |
+-------------------------------+

This was designed to make it easier to pull it fully closed.
However, you can't push a rope, so it's only one way.

Result:
This one is alsomost impossible to get started from the handle.
However, once it starts extending, it is easy to extend it fully.
I might be able to fix the starter issue by using a wider radius winch.

It also has to be pulled tightly to stay up.

The holes are smaller, and the scissor arms are thicker, but it's still drooping a bit.
Not bad.

Also, I appear to have gotten the pull distance long, looks off by a factor of 2.
Probably used diameter instead of radius somewhere.


+-------------------------------------------+
| Hookshot Prototype Three: Rack And Pinion |
+-------------------------------------------+

Realized that I can build a similar setup to the winch using a rack and pinion.
This is also reversable (unlike the winch).
Hopefully, by using a large radius for the pinion, it'll also be mechanically easy.

20 teeth is said to be optimal.
But I think that 12 teeth is easier to cut and better for strength, at least for the foam bard version.
An angle of pressure of 20deg is common, so I'll just trust that.

Angle of pressure determines the angle of the rack teeth because they need to be normal to each other.
In order for two surfaces to touch at a point, they need to be parallel (or discontinuous).
And the pressure is a normal force, QED.

The rack and pinion can both be represented by half a tooth, which is reflected and then transformed.
Rotated n times around for the pinion.
Translated up to times for the rack.

To determine how far each should move, each rotation of one pinion tooth is a translation of one rack tooth.
With width calculated as peak to peak for both
360/n deg -> (width of rack tooth, pk2pk)

If I understand it correctly, there is a sin(angle of pressure) transverse force.

I should add tracks for the handle piece moving backwards, it often gets stuck from slight rotations.
I can make this with lines cut out of the outer layer.
There needs to be a name for this kind of mechanism.

Trying to calculate using equations from
http://www.otvinta.com/rack.html
    clear;
    clc;
    u = linspace(0, 1, 10);
    x = 5.638 .* (cosd(u .* 0.822) .+ u .* 0.822 .* sind(u .* 0.822));
    y = 5.638 .* (sind(u .* 0.822) .- u .* 0.822 .* cosd(u .* 0.822));
    plot(x,y);
    axis('equal')
Not enough equations for the drawing.

Found software to help.

Found a better solution already.

Doesn't do racks.

Cool, this works:
http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html?circularPitch=8&pressureAngle=20&clearance=0.05&backlash=0.05&profileShift=0&gear1ToothCount=0&gear1CenterHoleDiamater=0&gear2ToothCount=12&gear2CenterHoleDiamater=1&showOption=3
With SVGs.

So does this:

But no SVGs.

12 is not enough, the foam version broke too easily.
Use 20 teeth.

Also, the scissor arms kept running into the track and the pinion teeth.
Need to put the rack onto a track.
I should also make the pinion radius enough that the track teeth are out of the way.
And if I make the pinion teeth on the small-arm side, then the track and pinion should move WITH the scissor arms.
And with the rack retracted out of the way, I can make the small-arms and pinion on the same plane.
With the pinion rotating forward, I can probably shape it to not need space behind it, which means that I can shorten the overall size.

Starting hookshot_v4.m to try out these improvements.

Result:
Started drawing it, and noticed issues already.

Moving forward does look like it would avoid collisions between the rack, teeth, and scissor arms.
However, it requires the rack to move forward, which extends the length of the case forward from where the pinion and scissors are fixed.
This shortens how long the arms extend out the front.

And the back is still very long.
However, I got an idea from this.
Since I want the scissor/pinion axel to be as close to the front as I can get it, why not have it move.

This would require the pinions to rotate against the motion of the arms, again, but I'll add a barrier with a gentle bevel.
This also means that instead of having a handle moving against the arms, I can skip that, the pinion/arms move, the rack/case stay still.

This is drawn up in hookshot_v5.m.

| Hookshot Prototype One: Scotch Yoke |
+-------------------------------------+

Result:
Due to the mechanics of the stoch yoke, it is effectively impossible to fully extend it via the handle.
Though it is easy to move when it's mostly retracted.

The wide holes with bolts are too loose.
That looseness causes what I'll call "droop".
When the handle is in the retracted position, the scissors can still fall about 1/4 of the way out due to looseness.

When it's fully extended, it droops downward due to gravity.
This strongly locks the scissors in the extended position.

| Hookshot Prototype Two: Winch |
+-------------------------------+

This was designed to make it easier to pull it fully closed.
However, you can't push a rope, so it's only one way.

Result:
This one is alsomost impossible to get started from the handle.
However, once it starts extending, it is easy to extend it fully.
I might be able to fix the starter issue by using a wider radius winch.

It also has to be pulled tightly to stay up.

The holes are smaller, and the scissor arms are thicker, but it's still drooping a bit.
Not bad.

Also, I appear to have gotten the pull distance long, looks off by a factor of 2.
Probably used diameter instead of radius somewhere.

| Hookshot Prototype Three: Rack And Pinion |
+-------------------------------------------+

Realized that I can build a similar setup to the winch using a rack and pinion.
This is also reversable (unlike the winch).
Hopefully, by using a large radius for the pinion, it'll also be mechanically easy.

20 teeth is said to be optimal.
But I think that 12 teeth is easier to cut and better for strength, at least for the foam bard version.
An angle of pressure of 20deg is common, so I'll just trust that.

Trying to calculate using equations from
http://www.otvinta.com/rack.html
    clear;
    clc;
    u = linspace(0, 1, 10);
    x = 5.638 .* (cosd(u .* 0.822) .+ u .* 0.822 .* sind(u .* 0.822));
    y = 5.638 .* (sind(u .* 0.822) .- u .* 0.822 .* cosd(u .* 0.822));
    plot(x,y);
    axis('equal')
Not enough equations for the drawing.

Found software to help.

Found a better solution already.

Doesn't do racks.

Cool, this works:
http://hessmer.org/gears/InvoluteSpurGearBuilder.html?circularPitch=8&pressureAngle=20&clearance=0.05&backlash=0.05&profileShift=0&gear1ToothCount=0&gear1CenterHoleDiamater=0&gear2ToothCount=12&gear2CenterHoleDiamater=1&showOption=3
With SVGs.

So does this:

But no SVGs.

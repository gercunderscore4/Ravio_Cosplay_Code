|Ravio Cosplay Code|
+------------------+


Overview
--------
I'm working on a cosplay of Ravio, the shopkeeper from The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, and I'm storing the code for it here.
I'm working on electronics for various items, and the code for those will be stored here.
I'll admit it, I'd keep this code private, except that I really like the convenience of storing it here.

There is also a physical log book for this project. Not all notes will be stored here.

I have a spare ADXL345 board.
It has I2C.

https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Accelerometer/ADXL345.pdf

With the SDO/ALT ADDRESS pin high, the 7-bit I2C address for the device is 0x1D, followed bythe R/W bit.
This translates to 0x3A for a write and 0x3B for a read.
An alternate I2C address of 0x53 (followed by the R/W bit) 
can be chosen by grounding the SDO/ALT ADDRESS pin (Pin 12).

Our uses 0x53 (confirmed).

The DEVID (address 0x00) register holds a fixed device ID code of 0xE5.
Success.
  Wire.beginTransmission(ACCEL_ADDR);
  Wire.write(byte(0x00));
  Wire.endTransmission();

  Wire.requestFrom(ACCEL_ADDR, 1);
  while(Wire.available()) {
      byte val = Wire.read();
      Serial.print("DEVICE ID: ");
      Serial.print(val, HEX);
      Serial.println("");
  }


Interrupts are enabled by setting the appropriate bit in the 
INT_ENABLE register (Address 0x2E)
and are mapped to either the INT1 or INT2 pin based on the contents of the 
INT_MAP register (Address 0x2F).
It is recommended that interrupt bits be configured with the interrupts disabled, 
preventing interrupts from being accidentally triggered during configuration.
This can be done by writing a value of 0x00 to the INT_ENABLE register.
Clearing interrupts is performed either by 
reading the data registers (Address 0x32 to Address 0x37) 
until the interrupt condition is no longer valid for the data-related interrupts 
or by reading the INT_SOURCE register (Address 0x30) for the remaining interrupts.

The SINGLE_TAP bit is set when a single acceleration event 
that is greater than the value in the 
THRESH_TAP register (Address 0x1D) 
occurs for less time than is specified in the 
DUR register (Address 0x21).
